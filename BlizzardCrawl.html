<i>As the icy winds howl through Bryn Shander, the weight of preparation falls unevenly across the group. Thunderdrum’s focus on his personal survival leaves others to bear the brunt of logistical planning. Terry’s divine foresight offers stability but is heavily reliant on uninterrupted magic to succeed. In the face of this imbalance, Shrop shoulders much of the burden, gathering resources, researching the enemy, and ensuring the group is physically prepared for the trials ahead. Grimbledee’s arcane expertise bolsters the team’s survival, though his efforts lack the collaborative spark needed to truly unify the party.
Your preparations earn 8 Blizzard Tokens, a solid foundation but one marked by uneven contributions. As you step into the Blizzard Crawl, survival will demand greater cohesion and shared purpose. The frozen expanse ahead offers no forgiveness for disunity; adapt and strengthen your bonds, or risk the wrath of the storm.</i><hr>
<h3><strong>Setup: Initial Party Conditions</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blizzard Tokens</strong>: The party begins with <strong>the determined number of Blizzard Tokens</strong> as a shared resource.</li>
<li><strong>Exhaustion Levels</strong>: Start with no exhaustion unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li><strong>Shelter Condition</strong>: The party begins with a fully functional tent unless damaged during prior events.</li>
<li><strong>Environment and Pursuit</strong>: The horde's movement creates a <strong>temporary calm in the eye of the blizzard</strong>, offering the closest positions some relief from the storm's fury. However, the farther the party travels from the horde, the <strong>more intense and dangerous the storm becomes</strong>. This dynamic encourages the party to consider staying closer to the horde for relative safety from the blizzard, but doing so increases the risk of <strong>frequent and dangerous encounters</strong> with patrols and stragglers.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Blizzard Token Depletion States</strong></h3>
<h6><span class="normal-weight">The effects of Blizzard Token Depletion States activate <strong>immediately</strong> upon reaching the listed token count. Depletion States are&nbsp;</span>cumulative<span class="normal-weight">. The Party <strong>cannot go below 0 Blizzard Tokens.</strong> A Party without any Blizzard Tokens <strong>cannot</strong> <strong>select a new</strong> <strong>Pursuit Distance</strong> and must remain where there were at the end of the previous day.<br></span></h6>

<h3><strong>Daily Process</strong></h3>
<p>Each day has three phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Morning Phase</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolve <strong>Daily Environmental Toll</strong></li>
<li>Attempt <strong>Camp Breakdown</strong>.</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Pursuit Level</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Travel Phase</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll for the <strong>Hazard</strong>, then roll for <strong>Weather</strong> and then <strong>Encounters </strong>based on <strong>Pursuit Level</strong>.</li>
<li>For each Weather Event, Hazard Event, or Encounter Event, the party must decide how to handle it: Avoid (Stealth, Survival, etc.), proceed cautiously (specific DC checks), or maybe engage in combat. Failure may cause Blizzard Token loss or other penalties. Combat is usually timed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evening Phase</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempt <strong>Camp Setup</strong>.</li>
<li>Resolve Blizzard Token recovery and shelter conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Before Bed:</strong> Individual party members may choose to <strong>spend 1 Blizzard Token</strong> for personal or party <strong>Advantage</strong>(s) during the next day’s travel. <strong>Advantage</strong>(s) stack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Phase Details</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2><strong>1. Morning Phase: Breaking Camp / Pursuit Level</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Daily Environmental Toll</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party automatically loses <strong>1 Blizzard Token</strong> each day to reflect the relentless toll of the environment. This loss is independent of any Blizzard Tokens spent or lost during <strong>Weather Events</strong>, <strong>Hazard Events</strong>, or <strong>Encounter Events</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Camp Breakdown Challenge</h4>
<p>Breaking camp in a blizzard is no easy task. Each party member makes a <strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Dexterity</strong>, <strong>Survival </strong><strong>or Wisdom check</strong> to dismantle the shelter and their packs efficiently (<strong>DC 14</strong>). The outcome determines whether the party can push forward or if the chaos of the storm holds them back.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Success (Half or More Succeed)</strong>:</p>
<p><em>The party works like a well-oiled machine. Tents are collapsed quickly, supplies packed tightly, and the group is ready to march within minutes. Spirits are high, and the path ahead feels achievable.</em></p>
<p>The party may start <strong>one level closer, at the same position, or any level farther back</strong> from their current position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Failure (Fewer than Half Succeed)</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Despite best efforts, the storm proves relentless. Frozen ropes and buried stakes slow progress, leaving the group frustrated and disorganized. Time slips away, and advancing closer feels impossible.</em></p>
<p>The party may <strong>only start at their current position or any level farther back</strong>. Moving closer is <strong>not permitted</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Failure (No Successes)</strong>:</p>
<p><em>A disastrous morning—gear is lost to the wind, tents collapse under icy gusts, and tempers fray as the group fights to salvage what they can. The storm exacts a toll, leaving everyone weary and battered.</em></p>
<p>The party may <strong>only start at their current position or any level farther back</strong>. Moving closer is <strong>not permitted</strong>, and they lose <strong>1 Blizzard Token</strong> to reflect wasted resources and energy.</p>
</li>

<h2><strong>3. Evening Phase: Setting Up Camp and Resting</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Camp Setup Challenge<br></strong>Each member makes a <strong>Strength, Dexterity, Survival, or Wisdom check</strong> (DC 14) to secure the tent<strong>:</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Full Success</strong> (Half or More Succeed)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: The tent is set up securely, providing full protection from the elements.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The party receives a <strong>Long Rest</strong>: All resources and spell slots are fully recovered.</li>
<li><strong>Blizzard Token Recovery</strong>: The group regains <strong>1 Blizzard Token the following morning</strong>, representing an efficient camp that conserves energy and resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Partial Success</strong> (Fewer than Half Succeed)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: The tent is only partially secured. While it provides some protection, it cannot withstand the full force of the blizzard.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The party receives only a <strong>Short Rest</strong>: They may spend hit dice to regain health but do not recover spell slots, and no Blizzard Token is regained.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Risk of Exhaustion</strong>: Partial shelter means that if any character is already at <strong>1 or more levels of exhaustion</strong>, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid gaining another level of exhaustion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Failure</strong> (No Successes)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: The tent setup fails completely, offering minimal shelter and leaving the party exposed to the worst of the blizzard’s fury.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Each member must make a <strong>DC 12 Constitution save</strong> to avoid gaining a level of <strong>exhaustion</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Recovery</strong>: The group only receives a <strong>Short Rest</strong>, with no spell slot recovery or Blizzard Token recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Tent Damage</strong>: If failed more than one night in a row, the tent begins to deteriorate, leading to <strong>increased setup and breakdown DCs by +2</strong> for each subsequent failure. (This can be repaired by spending a Blizzard Token for the “Patch Kit” advantage.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spending Blizzard Tokens for Advantages Before Bed<br></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each party member may spend <strong>1 Blizzard Token per night</strong> for personal or party advantages.</li>
<li>Advantages Stack</li>
<li>Team advantages typically affect the whole party but are often <strong>limited to one use</strong> per day. Personal advantages are specific to an individual and last for the full next day.

<p><strong>Exhaustion Levels and Effects</strong></p>
<p>In this mini-game, the standard D&amp;D exhaustion rules apply, with each level adding a debilitating effect that compounds as the party struggles through the relentless blizzard. Here’s a quick reference:</p>
<table>

<p><strong>Managing and Reducing Exhaustion</strong></p>
<p>Since exhaustion accumulates rapidly and affects the party’s survival, players will need opportunities to mitigate it. Here’s how they can manage exhaustion:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Long Rest with Successful Camp Setup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A successful Camp Setup allows the party to take a <strong>long rest</strong>, which reduces exhaustion by <strong>1 level</strong> for all members.</li>
<li>If the party achieves only a short rest, no exhaustion reduction occurs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Good Night’s Sleep</strong> (Individual Blizzard Token Expenditure)</p>
<ul>
<li>During the Rest Phase, a player can spend <strong>1 Blizzard Token</strong> for a <strong>Good Night’s Sleep</strong>, allowing them to ignore the Camp Setup result and automatically benefit from a full long rest.</li>
<li>This reduces their exhaustion level by <strong>1</strong>, even if the rest of the party only receives a short rest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Losing the Tent</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Immediate Consequences</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Exposure Risk</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without a functional tent, the party suffers increased exposure to the elements:
<ul>
<li><strong>Blizzard Tokens</strong>: The party loses <strong>1 additional Blizzard Token</strong> each day due to the lack of adequate shelter.</li>
<li><strong>Exhaustion Checks</strong>: Constitution saving throws to avoid exhaustion during the Evening Phase increase by <strong>+2 DC</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Camp Setup</strong>: Without a tent, Camp Setup checks automatically fail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Check</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the tent is damaged but repairable:
<ul>
<li>A character proficient in <strong>Carpenter’s Tools</strong> or <strong>Tinker’s Tools</strong> may attempt to repair it during the Evening Phase of they have their tools equipped. This requires a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Tools)</strong> check.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Losing the Horde and Mini-Game Failure</h3>
<p>If the party is in the <strong>Farthest Back Position</strong> (<strong>Far Shadow</strong>) and a weather event, hazard, or encounter <strong>forces them to fall back further</strong>, and they are <strong>unable or unwilling to spend Blizzard Tokens</strong> to prevent it, they lose track of the horde entirely.&nbsp;The mini-game ends, and the party is forced to abandon the pursuit and retreat to Ten-Towns, failing to discover the horde's destination or intervene in time. Losing the horde does not mean the campaign ends, but the party must regroup and face the consequences of failure.</p>
