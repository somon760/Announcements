<h3 style="color: #9ad3e6; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px;"><strong>⟡ The Aftershock ⟡</strong></h3>
<p>It is done. The crystal is broken. The conduit silenced. The bridge&mdash;blackened, fractured&mdash;still hangs over the void, but barely.</p>
<p>When Terry released the Irionite&rsquo;s grip, the instability began immediately. Ernie moved fast. Too fast. No words&mdash;just a whirlwind of chalk, flailing hands, and increasingly erratic gestures. The soldiers were urged off the bridge with wild arm sweeps and crude sketches of blast waves. The party held the line as Ernie frantically worked the Artifact. And then, without warning, Ernie had bolted&mdash;just as the first explosion cracked through the air as the Artifact went up in flames.</p>
<p>He flew farther than anyone expected. Propelled by a chain of detonations, he flailed like a rag doll and landed in a mess of limbs&mdash;caught by a pair of stunned Breakers, grinning through a cloud of dust and ash. Behind him, the bridge was gone.</p>
<h3 style="color: #9ad3e6; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px;"><strong>⟡ The Tunnel Beyond ⟡</strong></h3>
<p>The army has moved. Through the far arch, down the darkened tunnels beyond the Conduit Hall. The sound of collapsing stone has faded behind them. For the first time in hours&hellip; silence.</p>
<p>The soldiers are winded but alive. The fiends are gone. The Artifact is dust. Now, beneath a fortress built on lies and blood, Team Biscuit has a choice: press forward or rest&mdash;and let the war wait just one more hour.</p>
<h3 style="color: #9ad3e6; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px;"><strong>⟡ The Church Holds ⟡</strong></h3>
<p>News has yet to reach the surface. But if they could see what just happened, they would raise their banners twice as high. The plan is working. The pincer tightens. The demons reel.</p>
<p>But the deepest tunnels lie ahead. And whatever still guards the gate to the demon fortress&hellip; it hasn&rsquo;t made its move yet.</p>
