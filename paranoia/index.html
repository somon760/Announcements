            <h2>Welcome, Citizen</h2>
            <p>Congratulations, Citizen! You’ve been selected for a very special mission in Alpha Complex — a world where a cheerful but slightly unhinged AI insists it’s always right, treason is always fatal, and death is just another scheduling inconvenience.</p>
            <p>Expect claustrophobic corridors, malfunctioning tech, strange mutant abilities you probably shouldn’t use in public, and missions so simple they can only go spectacularly wrong. Imagine a blend of sci-fi satire and a deadly game show, with the chaotic dungeon-crawl energy of <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em>: slapstick danger, suspiciously cheerful corporate propaganda, and an audience that seems to be laughing at you as much as with you.</p>
            <p>This is a game where your character may explode, reclone, or become the proud new owner of a sponsor-branded gadget you never wanted — all in the name of loyalty, ratings, and survival. You’ll laugh, you’ll panic, you’ll probably explode… and then you’ll come right back for more.</p>
